"""File Overlap.

Given two .txt files that have lists of
numbers in them, find the numbers that are
overlapping. One .txt file has a list of
all prime numbers under 1000, and the
other .txt file has a list of happy
numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers
that canâ€™t be divided by any other number.
And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in
mathematics - you can look it up on
Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with
an example, which I will describe below.)

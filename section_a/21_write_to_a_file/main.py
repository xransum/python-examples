"""Write To A File.

Take the code from the "How To Decode A
Website" exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or
just want to play with some different
code, use the code from the solution), and
instead of printing the results to a
screen, write the results to a txt file.

In your code, just make up a name for the
file you are saving to.

Extras:
    - Ask the user to specify the name of
      the output file that will be saved.
